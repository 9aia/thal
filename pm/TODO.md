# TODO

## 0.1.6

- Check message length using zod
- Keep username in edition unless asked
- Virtual scroll for chats, messages and discover
- Add infinite queries to lists (specially chat)
- Force test with ton of characters, chats, contacts and messages
- Consider userId in query keys

- Find a way to use the Thal app for free for selected users

- Create characters
- Share Thal with friends, family, colleagues, etc.

## 0.1.7

- Language Practice Reminders: Send notifications encouraging users to engage in language practice with their saved characters.
  - Daily/week reminders to keep users practicing
  - Push Notifications: Reminders and encouragement to practice regularly
  - Add to terms that we can send email notifying messages of characters (after off-line daily)

- After days not used the app, the character sends a message (powered by character memory to create a persuasive but with the character persnality). The idea is t ouse 1–2 facts of the user or them (e.g. name, hobby, last topic). Drop them naturally like “So, how’s your guitar practice going?” Boom—instant connection. (This improves Retention)
