## **Feature Proposal: Personalized Learning Insights & Reports**

### **Context**

Our platform currently provides **real-time feedback** on grammar, spelling, and (soon) vocabulary pitfalls like false cognates. This helps users in the moment, but **patterns in mistakes are not tracked** over time.

As a result, recurring weaknesses may go unnoticed by the learner — and opportunities for targeted improvement are missed.

### **Feature Overview: Learning Insights**

A system that **analyzes the user’s most common mistakes** over time and:

1. Generates **personalized reports** showing recurring grammar, spelling, or vocabulary issues.
2. Suggests **focused practice and guidance** to address these specific weaknesses.
3. Optionally adapts **real-time feedback intensity** to emphasize problem areas.

### **Key Behaviors**

1. **Mistake Tracking**

   * Log each detected issue by type, category, and frequency.
   * Example categories: *verb tense*, *false cognates*, *article usage*, *spelling variants*, *idiomatic misuse*.

2. **Pattern Analysis**

   * Identify top recurring mistakes in a time window (e.g., last week/month).
   * Track progress trends — is the user improving in a certain area?

3. **Personalized Recommendations**

   * Offer focused exercises, explanations, or challenges targeting high-frequency issues.
   * Could be interactive micro-lessons or quick quizzes.

4. **User Reports**

   * A clean, visual dashboard or downloadable report.
   * Metrics: frequency, severity, improvement over time, best/worst categories.

### **Why This Matters**

* **Turns feedback into learning strategy** — not just “what’s wrong now” but “what you need to master.”
* **Boosts motivation** — visible progress encourages continued learning.
* **Increases retention** — focusing on repeated mistakes ensures they are corrected for good.
* **Differentiates product** — moves from reactive correction to proactive skill-building.

### **Implementation Outline**

1. **Data Collection Layer** – Extend current feedback system to tag and log all mistakes (with timestamps, categories, and context).
2. **Analysis Engine** – Batch process logs to detect patterns and generate summaries.
3. **Report UI** – Simple, engaging dashboard with charts (e.g., pie for mistake types, line for progress).
4. **Recommendation Engine** – Suggest resources or exercises directly related to the most frequent mistakes.
5. **Adaptive Feedback Mode (optional)** – Temporarily increase focus on repeated issues in real-time corrections.

### **Impact on the User**

* **Before**: Learners fix mistakes as they go, but may keep making the same ones.
* **After**: Learners see clear, data-driven insights into their weaknesses, with tailored guidance to overcome them.
