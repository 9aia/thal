## **Feature Proposal: Real-Time Interception for Repeated Mistakes**

### **Context**

* **Current approach**: Detects grammar, spelling, and soon vocabulary mistakes *after* the message is sent, with feedback appearing in a modal.
* **Limitation**: Repeated mistakes slip through in the flow of conversation, with the correction coming too late for effective reinforcement.
* **Philosophy conflict**: We don’t want to interrupt the conversation with separate lessons, quizzes, or “classroom-style” activities. The app’s value is in *learning through natural conversation*.

### **New Insight**

When a **common, repeated mistake** is detected in real time *before the message is sent*, the app can:

1. **Pause** the message delivery (the chat “freezes” momentarily).
2. **Notify** the user:

   * Show the specific mistake.
   * Explain *why* it’s a recurring issue.
   * Provide a quick inline fix option.
3. Once corrected, the message is sent as normal and the conversation continues smoothly.

### **Why It Works**

* **Stays inside the conversation flow** — no switching to “lesson mode.”
* **Hits when the brain is most receptive** — the moment the user is about to commit the same mistake again.
* **Reinforces learning through repetition prevention** — encourages *breaking the habit*.
* **Feels like a supportive coach** — not a teacher stopping class, but a friend saying “hey, you’ve done this before, let’s nail it this time.”

### **Example Flow**

1. User types: *“I have 24 years old.”*
2. System detects **present perfect misuse for age** — known common mistake for this user.
3. Chat UI “pauses” with a subtle overlay:

   > “Looks like this is a mistake you’ve made before. In English, we say *I am 24 years old.* Want to fix it before sending?”
4. User edits to: *“I am 24 years old.”*
5. Message sends normally, conversation continues.

### **Implementation Outline**

1. **Mistake Memory** – From the “Learning Insights” feature, maintain a personal mistake profile for each user.
2. **Real-Time Detection** – Before sending, check the draft message against that profile.
3. **Pause Mechanism** – Intercept message sending, show a small in-context edit prompt.
4. **Quick Fix Guidance** – One-line explanation + suggested correction.
5. **Adaptive Learning** – Track how often the user corrects without help to eventually stop flagging it.

### **Impact on the User**

* **Before**: Common mistakes slip into the conversation, corrected only after the fact.
* **After**: The app catches and corrects habitual mistakes *before they hit the conversation*, reinforcing correct usage in a natural, unobtrusive way.

---

This approach essentially turns **common mistakes into “soft guardrails”** in the conversation, which feels much more like *real conversational coaching* than like *school exercises*.
