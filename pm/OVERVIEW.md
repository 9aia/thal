# Project Overview

## Description

Thal is an AI-powered English learning app inspired by messaging apps, designed to help users practice English through immersive, chat-based interactions with personalized characters. By simulating real-life conversations, Thal creates a dynamic and engaging environment for users to enhance their language skills. The app offers tailored experiences, allowing users to create custom characters for various contexts and receive real-time language assistance, including translations, corrections, and suggestions. With a focus on community involvement, users can share and discover characters created by others, enriching their learning experience. Thalâ€™s intuitive interface is optimized for use across devices, making language learning accessible, engaging, and personalized for all levels of proficiency.
