# Project Overview

## Description

Thal is a chat-based, AI-powered English learning app that helps users practice English in a natural and interactive way. Inspired by messaging apps, Thal simulates real-life conversations, making language learning feel intuitive and engaging.

## Goals

* **Enhance Language Learning**: Create an engaging and effective environment for users to develop and improve their language skills through dynamic interactions.
* **Promote Personalization**: Provide tailored learning experiences that adapt to individual needs and preferences, making the process more relevant and impactful.
* **Foster Community Involvement**: Encourage user participation in content creation and sharing, building a collaborative and diverse learning ecosystem.

## Scope

Thal focuses on a select set of features to ensure a streamlined and effective English learning experience:

* **AI Conversations**: Chat with AI-driven characters that simulate real-world conversations.
* **Custom Characters**: Create unique characters for different contexts like casual, business, or other areas of focus.
* **Real-time Assistance**: Get suggestions, translations, quick access to a dictionary, and more.
* **Community Sharing**: Share and explore characters created by other users to enrich your learning experience.

**The project does not include:**

* **Non-English Language Learning**: The app focuses solely on English and does not provide lessons for other languages.
* **Formal Certification or Accreditation**: The app will not offer official language certificates or academic qualifications.
* **Classroom-style Teaching**: No lecture-style learning, formal language classes, or textbook-style instruction will be included.
* **Gamification**: The app does not integrate elements such as achievements, leaderboards, and rewards to motivate users.
* **Extensive Progress Tracking**: While conversations adjust based on your performance, there is no formal progress report.

## Requirements

To make the most of Thal, the users will need:

* **Device and Browser Compatibility**: Responsive web app that works on any modern device (smartphone, tablet, or desktop). It requires an up-to-date web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) with **internet access**.
* **English Proficiency**: Suitable for all levels. The app can be used with minimal knowledge of English, and the UI can be set to Portuguese if needed.
* **Commitment**: Regular practice and active engagement are essential to maximize the learning experience with Thal.
